<h2>Introduction</h2>

The C++ Online Shopping System project aims to create a simple and practical platform for online shopping. Useres can browse products, add items to their shopping cart, place orders, manage their accounts, request delivery, add a gift message, read data from a file, save it and allow them to register, providing a hands-on experience in building an e-commerce platform.
